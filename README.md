## Weather App
This application allows you to get the current weather in your location or search for a city and get the
current weather there. 

I used Node.js and Express.js to create a simple backend that calls the OpenWeatherAPI to get the current weather.

## Running the Project
In the main project directory (the weather-app directory), run: 

 `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
